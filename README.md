# unique-combinations-app

I like to make video games on my free time and I often need to know the number of non-repeating combinations that are possible when crafting items or food. I created this tiny app that calculates how many unique combinations are possible and lists each combination so I can focus on other tasks.

## How It Works

I used the combinations formula to calcuate all possible unique combinations.

'N' represents the total amount of items there are to choose from. 'R' represents the number of items it takes to make one combination. By applying this formula to my JavaScript code I was able to generate unique combinations and populate a list.
